This is a group project where we set of to figure out how
to make a map of the campus sidewalks, figure out running paths.
Oh and to also make sure you can find the fastest way to get to class,
just in case your are running late. Enjoy.

Oh and just in case, this is for GVSU, and is a work in progress.
